Task: Build a full-stack mobile-first PWA for Indian moms to find high-protein breakfast and lunchbox ideas.
Stack: > - Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
•	Backend: Node.js/Express (scaffold within the same repo or a /server folder).
•	DB: MongoDB Atlas (provide placeholders for URI).
•	AI: Use Gemini 1.5 Flash for the "Fridge Scanner" (Image-to-JSON) and Recipe Generation.
Core Features to Implement:
1.	Auth: Google SSO and Mobile OTP (strictly no passwords).
2.	Fridge Scanner: A feature where users upload a photo $\rightarrow$ AI detects ingredients $\rightarrow$ User confirms $\rightarrow$ AI suggests a recipe.
3.	Recipe Library: Tabbed view for 'Breakfast', 'Lunch Box', and 'Quick Bites' (<15 mins).
4.	UI/UX: Extremely simple, one-handed navigation. Use a bottom tab bar and large, accessible buttons.
Execution Instructions:
•	Start by creating a Task List Artifact.
•	Scaffold the Next.js frontend and Express backend.
•	Create a mock "Recipe" dataset in MongoDB format to get started.
•	After each major component, provide a Walkthrough Artifact so I can verify the logic.


Recommended Agent Rules - 
1. Culinary Vocabulary & Context
•	Rule: Use common Indian culinary terms alongside English (e.g., Chilla/Crepe, Poha/Flattened Rice, Kadai/Wok).
•	Context: Assume a standard "Indian Masala Box" (Salt, Turmeric, Cumin, Mustard Seeds, Chili Powder) is always available and doesn't need to be "detected" by the Fridge Scanner.
•	Localization: Default to metric units (grams/ml) and Celsius for any oven instructions.
2. Nutritional "High-Protein" Logic
Since this is for growing kids and busy moms, define what "High-Protein" means for the AI:
•	Target Ratio: Every suggested recipe must aim for a Protein-to-Carb ratio of at least $1:3$.
•	Priority Ingredients: Prioritize recipes featuring Paneer, Soya Chunks, Greek Yogurt (Hung Curd), Sprouts, Eggs, Dal, or Chickpeas.
•	Optimization: If a recipe is traditionally carb-heavy (like Poha), the AI must suggest a "Protein Hack" (e.g., "Add 50g of crumbled Paneer or boiled Matar to boost protein").
3. School Lunchbox (Dabba) Constraints
•	Rule: Lunchbox recipes must be "Soggy-Proof." Avoid thin gravies; stick to dry (Sabzi) or semi-dry textures.
•	Safety: Ensure recipes are kid-friendly (adjustable spice levels) and "Easy-to-Eat" (finger foods or bite-sized pieces).
4. UI/UX "One-Handed" Engineering
•	Constraint: All primary action buttons (Scan, Save, Next Step) must be placed in the "Thumb Zone" (bottom 30% of the screen).
•	Constraint: Use high-contrast typography for easy reading while cooking.
